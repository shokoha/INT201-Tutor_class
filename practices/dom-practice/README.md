# Game Management Program

This project involves managing a list of games using various features such as searching, adding, and removing games from the list. Below are the details and requirements for implementing the program.

## Files Overview
You are provided with the following files:

1. **index.html** - The main HTML file.
2. **./lib/GameManagement.js** - Contains game properties, a constructor, and methods for managing games.
3. **./data/gameData.js** - Provides initial game data created using the `GameManagement` class.
4. **main.js** - The file where you will implement the program using nested functions (do not edit the initial code provided).

## main.js Requirements

### Constant Variables:
- **games**: The initial game data list created from the `GameManagement` class.

### Nested Functions to Implement:

#### 1. **registerEventHandling()**
This function is responsible for adding event listeners for various game management actions:
- Register a `"keyup"` event on the search input field. When the user types, the `searchGames` function should be triggered to filter and display games based on the search keyword.
- Register a `"click"` event for the `"Add Game"` button to add new games. The event handler function should be `addGame`.
- Register a `"click"` event for the `"Remove All Games"` button to remove all games. The event handler function should be `removeAllGames`.

#### 2. **addGame()**
This function adds a new game to the list:
- Retrieves the game's name and price from the respective input fields.
- Adds the new game to the list using the `addNewGame(name, price)` method in `GameManagement`.
- Displays the new game in the display area (`#game-list`) using the `displayGame(newGameObject)` function.
- Clears the input fields for name and price after adding the game.

#### 3. **displayGames(gameItems)**
This function displays the list of games:
- Clears all previous children in the `#game-list` div.
- Iterates over the `gameItems` array and calls `displayGame(gameItem)` for each game.

Example structure for displaying the games:

```html
<div id="game-list">
  <!-- Game list will be displayed here -->
</div>

```
#### 4. **displayGame(gameItem)**
Dynamically creates HTML elements for a single game based on the following structure:
```html
    <div class="game-item">
      <p>name price THB</p>
      <button id="name-price" class="remove-btn">Remove</button>
    </div>
```

Creates a ```<div>``` with the class game-item.
Adds the game name, price, and a "Remove" button:
The "Remove" button is a ```<button>``` element with:
A class of remove-btn.
An id attribute that concatenates the game name and price with a hyphen (-).
Example id for the game "Splatoon 2 550": id="Splatoon 2-550".
Adds an event handler to the "Remove" button that calls the removeGame function when clicked.
Example HTML for a game {name: 'Splatoon 2', price: 550}:

```html
    <div class="game-item">
      <p>Splatoon 2 550 THB</p>
      <button id="Splatoon 2-550" class="remove-btn">Remove</button>
    </div>
```

### 5. **searchGames(event)**
This function filters games based on a search keyword:
- Calls the searchGames(keyword) function in GameManagement using the search input value.
- Displays the matching games in real time by calling displayGames(gameItems).
### 6. **removeGame(event)**
This function removes a game:
- Triggered by clicking the "Remove" button next to a game's name.
- Retrieves the game's name and price from the id attribute of the clicked button.
- Removes the game from the list using the removeGame(deleteGame) method in GameManagement.
- Updates the display area by removing the ```<div>``` element for the deleted game.
